Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow of Statistics at Purdue University. I am working with Prof. Anindya Bhadra on developing Bayesian nonparametric model with Gaussian process priors and stable process priors. Previously, I obtained my doctoral degree in statistics under the supervision of Prof. Malay Ghosh.

My primary research interests include Bayesian inference, high dimensional statistics, nonparameric inference and machine learning.
